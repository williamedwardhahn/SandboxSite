<h4>Motor Cognition</h4>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1g-Sr5GXfr6K4pAYL2wkiwaqhC2V0LqYT" alt="" /></span>Motor cognition is the notion that understanding is often grounded in our action capabilities. The roots of the word perception translate to “grasping with mind”. Our ability to move and interact within our environment shapes our mental representations. Often complex behaviors can be derived from simple mechanical linkages, suggesting that seemingly cognitive tasks can be accomplished with simple action-perception loops, i.e. Braitenberg vehicles. Going beyond sensory input, motor cognition considers the structures necessary for the planning and production of actions, as well as recognizing, predicting, and mimicking the actions of others. </p>

<h4>Texture Recognition</h4>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=10XKuiUouZ2euQ_mGCgL5_5bz4E3nZyHm" alt="" /></span>Natural images can often be decomposed into cartoon and texture. While much work has been done on edge detection, of equal importance is the ability to recognize and classify different texture patterns. From terrain estimation for autonomous vehicles to medical image analysis, the ability to identify and segment complex textures represents a major challenge for existing image processing techniques. Inspired by the human visual system, sparse dictionary modeling has shown to yield state of the art results in visual discrimination tasks.</p>

<h4>Sound Analysis</h4>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1Lbnu-Dclkc-GITFnQX9imJIQHPGZlgju" alt="" /></span>The cocktail party effect refers to the human brain’s ability to selectively tune into a particular conversation amidst many competing conversations and significant background noise. The separation and grouping of acoustic data streams is called auditory scene analysis. Given the current trends in big data it will be come increasingly more important to selectively and dynamically attend to salient subsets of the data. Perceptual binding of music and speech amidst competing background noise is something that the brain can do almost effortlessly but for only a single steam at a time. Machine techniques should allow for the segmentation and binding of multiple streams concurrently.</p>

<h4>Video AI</h4>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1vGoMQmSA2rVuyBWLNdXDmiBv2f6R5ZQE" alt="" /></span>It would take an individual over 5 million years to watch the amount of video that will cross the internet each month in 2018, by then, every second, nearly a million minutes of video content will cross the network. Closed circuit television cameras networks have become ubiquitous in many major cities yet most of the data goes unexamined. Video will be in the range of 80 to 90 percent of global internet traffic by 2018. Without automated means to sort and analyze this video data we will be unable to take advantage of humanity’s largest data stream. Compressed sensing and sparse modeling now offer a means to tackle this global deluge.</p>

<h4>Python Tips and Tricks: Episode 0</h4>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1g7DJ5t9bW2AZrw53-dLDH-DR5v-NBr6Q" alt="" /></span>As I was trying to ensure my random seeds were set correctly, I found some interesting tricks with writing python ints that I wanted to share here: First off, as you likely know, python reads a series of numbers as a decimal integer, but you can use hexadecimal by prefixing with 0x, binary by prefixing with 0b, and octal by prefixing with 0o. In addition, you can write floats in engineering notaton by appending e and the power of 10. I also found out that, while spaces and commas between digits in long numbers are invalid, you can place a single underscore between two digits in a number to make it more human readable.

Example
Plain: 1234
Plain with separators: 1_234
Engineering: 1.234e3
Hex: 0x4d2
Binary: 0b10011010010
Binary with separators: 0b_100_1101_0010</p>

<h4>Solresol Language Flashcards</h4>
<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1RHFRPbyhZfZbAT6Vt3FpZiB9BTE9gsli" alt="" /></span>Solresol is a conlang that I have been trying to learn. The beautiful thing about the language is its many representations, including as spoken words, abbreviated spoken words (ses), numbers, musical notes, and even stenographic glyphs. I have begun writing some code to help convert Solresol between its many forms, and have also created some flash cards to help learn the words and stenographic script. Let me know if there is interest in a Solresol study group or some other collaborative learning.
