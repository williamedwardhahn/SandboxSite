<h1>What is the MPCR Lab?</h1>
</header>
<p>The Machine Perception and Cognitive Robotics Laboratory is a multidisciplinary research group dedicated to understanding the foundational mechanisms of intelligent systems. All projects and activities in the lab are focused towards building a model of the brain. At the core of our research is a custom simulation and machine learning platform that allows for perception-action experiments. Individuals and teams in the lab work on modules that they think are relevant towards that overall goal. Some of these modules will consist of 3D simulated environments, others modules will consist of theoretical components such as hypervectors, locally competitive algorithms or long short term memory networks.</p>

What is a BrAIn Module?
</h1>
</header>
<p>
A module is a component of our BrAIn simulation. The goal is to build up model complexity one module at a time. Our baseline models are little more than an eye, a couple muscles, and a couple of neurons. From that baseline we add complexity in a number of different ways. This includes adding new sensors, new learning modules, and new environments. The number of ways you can help contribute to the project are almost endless! 
<br>
<ul>
<li>Eyes</li>
<li>Ears</li>
<li>Touch</li>
<li>Voices</li>
<li>Anatomical Brain Regions</li>
<li>Mathematical Model Components</li>
<li>T Maze</li>
</ul>
