After Guilford, William studied artificial intelligence and immune systems at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro before joining the Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences at Florida Atlantic University in 2011. In 2016, he received a Ph.D. for his work in Sparse Coding and Compressed Sensing, and is now an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Florida Atlantic University and the co-director of the Machine Perception and Cognitive Robotics Laboratory.</p>

He began his career as an experimental psychologist, investigating human perception from a behavioral/cognitive-science perspective. The remarkable recent success of artificial neural networks—computer simulations of brain computation that learn—convinced him that an important piece of the puzzle of the brain had been discovered. He co-founded the MPCR to develop theories and applications of broad brain properties—such as perception, attention, curiosity and creativity — and test them embedded in robotic agents and applied to real-world problems. Since 2015, the MPCR has engaged hundreds of people across academic levels, scientific disciplines and industries in the new field of deep learning artificial intelligence and its many applications. Elan earned his Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology/Cognitive Science at Rutgers University and postdoctoral study at Brown University.

She writes about the nature of the self and mind, especially from the vantage point of issues in philosophy, AI, cognitive science and astrobiology.  In her recent book, Artificial You: AI and the Future of the Mind, she discusses the philosophical implications of AI, and, in particular, the enterprise of "mind design." As the NASA chair, Schneider has recently completed a two year project with NASA on the future of intelligence. She now works with Congress on AI policy. She also appears frequently on television shows on stations such as PBS and The History Channel (see below for clips).  She writes opinion pieces for the New York Times, Scientific American and The Financial Times.  Her work has been widely discussed in the media (see "media" above). She is currently working on a new book on the shape of intelligent systems (for W.W. Norton).  </p>

I moved to the United States to attend my senior year of high school as a foreign exchange student. During that year, I managed to earn an athletic scholarship from Florida State University. After graduating, I spent several years playing professional football with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New York Giants. 
Following my professional career, I continued pursuing my passion for athletics by training and educating hundreds of athletes and fitness enthusiasts as a performance instructor. However, after years of studying with the National Academy of Sports Medicine, I recognized the lack of focus on the cognitive processes necessary to perform at an optimal level. That is when I started educating myself on behavioral psychology, which soon made me realize my passion for studying the brain and how it produces behavior.</p>
